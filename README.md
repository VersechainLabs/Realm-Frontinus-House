# overview:
The Realms Autonomous World (RAW) aspires to truly live up to its name: Autonomous. This autonomy, however, is contingent on the presence of infrastructure - typically referred to as public goods. This understanding gives rise to the concept of Frontinus House, a means through which capital can be deployed and projects funded within the RAW and the broader BibliothecaDAO ecosystem.

Frontinus House will initiate funding rounds during which builders present the most innovative and compelling project ideas that resonate with the vision, mission, and goals of Bibliotheca DAO.

The ultimate goal of Frontinus House is to foster a culture of transparency, accountability, and collaboration in the utilisation of public capital. It also aims to back the development of superior public infrastructure tailored to meet the community's needs.

# Scope:
The work will be completed by Metaforo, a community of builders dedicated to providing Web3 native governance solutions for decentralised DAOs and crypto projects. With a focus on true web3 governance, they have developed Metaforo.io, a community forum system designed to facilitate transparent and fair decision-making by the community.

Firstly I would recommend reading the Frontinus House Proposal by Metaforo here and the Frontinus house outline by Neotins here. 

Metaforo will complete the full tech stack of the Frontinus House protocol. The current proposal and costs are for an off-chain only stack with the option to convert to a fully on-chain stack once Bibliotheca DAO governance has ossified.

# Steps to completion of protocol:
1. Proposal and Planning: The first step is to create a comprehensive proposal for the Frontinus House protocol. This proposal should outline the objectives, features, and technical requirements of the protocol. It should also include a detailed plan for its development and implementation.

2. Development of the Tech Stack: The protocol development begins with the creation of the technology stack. Metaforo, as mentioned, will be responsible for completing the full tech stack of Frontinus House. This involves designing and building the necessary software components, infrastructure, and systems required for the protocol to function effectively.

3. Off-Chain Implementation: Initially, the proposed implementation is off-chain. This means that the protocol operates outside of the blockchain. During this stage, the off-chain stack is developed and integrated into the Bibliotheca DAO. It involves setting up the infrastructure and systems required to facilitate the funding rounds, capital deployment, and delegate selection processes.

4. Testing and Iteration: Once the off-chain implementation is complete, thorough testing and iteration are necessary to identify and resolve any bugs, issues, or inefficiencies in the protocol. This phase ensures that the protocol functions as intended and meets the requirements and expectations of the community.

5. Community Review and Governance: The completed protocol is presented to the Bibliotheca DAO community for review and governance. The community members have the opportunity to provide feedback, suggest improvements, and vote on the adoption of the Frontinus House protocol. This step ensures that the protocol aligns with the vision, mission, and objectives of Bibliotheca DAO and that the community has a say in its implementation.

6. On-Chain Conversion (Optional): Depending on the decisions made during the governance process, there may be a transition from an off-chain stack to a fully on-chain stack. This step involves migrating the protocol's functionality and operations onto a blockchain platform. It enables the protocol to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology, such as transparency, immutability, and decentralised governance.

7. Deployment and Adoption: Once the protocol is deemed ready for production use, it can be deployed and made available to the Bibliotheca DAO. The community members can begin utilising the Frontinus House protocol to fund projects, auction capital, and collaborate on the development of public infrastructure that aligns with the community's needs.
# Features Overview
1. The projectâ€™s core feature is to pass funding for proposals:   
Communities hold funding rounds in the community. In these funding rounds, builders can propose ideas to get funded. The flow is as follows: 
    1. The funding rounds in Bibliotheca DAO are initiated by community members. However, before a round is posted, it goes through an admin review process. This ensures that only projects that align with the vision, mission, and objectives of Bibliotheca DAO are posted. Each funding round has a fixed amount of capital to be won, such as 1 ETH for 5 winners, and consists of a proposing and voting period.
    2. During the proposing period, builders can propose. Builders can now propose ideas that they'd like to get funded for. 
    3. Proposing period ends and the voting period starts. 
    4. Realms NFT holders vote on their favourite proposals. Voting period ends. The top proposals get funded. The fund is transferred to the winning proposal by the treasury. 
    5. All content will be stored on Arweave including proposals and voting results.  
	
2. User Wallet Login                                                                   
Realms NFT is on ETH mainnet for the time being. If using Realms NFT as the asset for voting validation, we will implement ETH mainnet wallet connection first. We will add other wallets support, such as agentX, braavos when Realms assets are moved onto Starknet. 

3. Voting feature                                                                       
    1. The Voting Gate is the Realms NFT. Each Realm's NFT counts as 1 voting power.
    2. For each vote, the same NFT can only be cast once. Even if changing wallets, it will still be considered as having voted.
    3. The system will support multiple-choice and single-choice voting. 
    4. Each vote can be set with a quorum and approving rate. 
    5. The system will support all member votes and delegation votes.

4. Delegation feature                                                                
   Within an ongoing proposal, qualifying voters can delegate their voting power to a certain delegation, to vote on their behalf.
    1. The selection rounds should open on a rolling basis. We suggest once every three months, but the timing for conducting the delegation selection rounds should be determined by the community.
        1. The operations team, on behalf of the DAO, initiates a round of delegate selections. It should be made clear with the opening of the round that the delegates for the period will be the top x ranked candidates based on the number of votes they received.
        2. Realms NFT holders submit proposals to campaign for becoming delegates.
        3. Realms NFT holders vote on the proposals to select the delegate for the period. 
        4. Delegates are selected and will carry the voting power their supporters grant them and have voting permissions to vote until the next round of Delegate Selection opens. 

    2. Delegation Voting feature
      Delegates will vote with the voting power granted to them by their supporters. For example, during the Delegate Selection voting phase, if a delegate receives 10 votes and is chosen as a delegate for the DAO, all of their votes will be counted with a voting power of 10.

5. Comment feature                                                                       
    With predetermined permissions, users can discuss or publish feedback under proposal. All comments will be stored on Arweave. The comment section will support markdown with full editor and can be viewed in different page views.
